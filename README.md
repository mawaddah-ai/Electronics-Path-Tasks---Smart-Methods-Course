this repository contains tasks of Electronics path with smart methods

TASK ONE :
Tinkercad Circuit - LED Control 

TASK TWO :



PART A .....
6 servo motors 
This project demonstrates how to control **5 servo motors** using an Arduino. The motors are programmed to:
- Perform a **Sweep motion** (0° → 180° → 0°) for **2 seconds**
- Then hold at a **fixed angle of 90°**

PART B ......
1. Set all servo motors to the standing position, or 90°.

2. Begin the Walking Loop:

   For every step ahead, repeat these steps:

   Adjust the left hip and tilt the torso slightly to the left in order to shift body weight to the **left leg**.
      For stability, lock the joints of the left leg.

   b. Raise the right hip joint (servo angle increases) by lifting the **right leg**.
      Reduce the servo angle by bending the right knee.
      To keep the foot horizontal, adjust the right ankle.

   c. Rotate the right hip slightly forward and move the right leg **forward**.

   d. Set down the right leg:
      Bring the ankle back to a flat position and straighten the knee.
      Keep the foot firmly planted on the ground.

   e. Transfer the weight of the body to the **right leg**:
      Raise your torso a little to the right.
      For support, lock the joints in your right leg.

   f. Lifting the **left leg** entails the following: - Raise the left hip joint - Bend the left knee - Adjust the ankle to balance

   g. Swing the left leg from the hip to move it **forward**.

   The left leg should be placed **down**.
      Ground the foot; bring the ankle back to neutral; and straighten the knee.

3. For continued walking, repeat the loop.

4. To stop walking, raise both legs to a standing posture and turn all servos to 90 degrees.
